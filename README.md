### Hi, I am Gustavo!

As a Senior Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience crafting scalable digital solutions, I've spent the last 8 years collaborating with global teams to turn complex challenges into seamless experiences. Specializing in PHP and Laravel, I'm a go-to expert in building robust web apps, RESTful APIs, and microservices. My tools of trade also include Vue.js, PostgreSQL/MySQL, Postman testing, GitHub Actions CI/CD, and Docker containerization. From data pipelines to database tuning, I thrive on automation and optimization in fast-paced environments.

In healthtech, pharma, and financial sectors, I've led the design of high-traffic platforms handling massive datasets. Highlights include engineering a highly flexible tool for medical research that accelerated clinical trial data analysis; improving logistics tools to manage an 8x surge in data exchanges; enhancing mobile audit apps for on-the-go efficiency; and integrating EDI for frictionless CRM workflows. These innovations delivered measurable ROI while ensuring regulatory alignment.

As a guiding force for cross-functional teams in Agile/Scrum, I foster open communication and adaptive strategies to deliver high-quality, impactful features on time. What fuels me? The thrill of leveraging tech to solve real-world problems and empower teams.

Currently gearing up for AWS certifications and exploring AI integrations to supercharge project workflows.

If you are looking for a skilled and experienced web developer who can help your company build high-quality products, I would love to hear more about your needs and discuss how I can contribute to your team.
